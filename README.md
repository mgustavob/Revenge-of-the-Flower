# Revenge of the Flower

## Intro

### This is a GA project to create a game,that requires:
* A welcoming screen with instructions on how to play the game
* A clasic game that follows game logic
* A situation where the game will be over
* A score that will be compare to the highest score and return the highest of them both
* A restart the game option

## My take

I wanted to create a different take on the classic Snake mix it with another classic, Mario Bross, but give this time the Hero spot to the poor flowers that die to the evil hands of the plummer!

Started with a basic project that was already done called canvas crawler, and modified as I needed to:

* Create a function where “target” will spawn at a random place
* Make it so that once the target is death it respawn
* Change the java script so that it goes in the direction and don’t need to be push
* Adding spaces to the Snake body once it eats the target
* Use Sprite Ifound online for the snake and Mario
* Use some 'Zelda' music ;)
* Added Score and MVP
