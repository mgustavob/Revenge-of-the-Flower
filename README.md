# Snake
Start with crawler
Create a function where “target” will spawn at a random place
Make it so that once the target is death it respawn
Change the java script so that it goes in the direction and don’t need to be push
divide the screen so that it puts the snake in predeterminated line (example 600 px / 10 px makes 60 lines for the snake to go around)
Adding spaces once it eats the target
Challenges the body trails the head
